# Smart-Attendance-System

## TOPIC DESCRIPTION
This application is an Attendance Management System for schools & colleges. Basic idea behind the project is to ease the process of marking the attendance by the lecturer. 
More specifically, this system will be designed to help the lecturer mark the attendance using the latest technologies like Machine Learning (ML). The system also contains a database containing the data of the student.

## RELEVANCE OF TOPIC
Any organization, either large or small, requires an attendance tracking system for effective maintenance of projects and tasks. It is essential for the management to have records of the time and attendance of each student to handle discrepancies and variations within the organization. In todayâ€™s competitive world, each and every technology has drastic improvements when automated. Since, manual attendance tracking is a tedious and inefficient process for a group of students, the smart attendance management system with face recognition capabilities takes a huge leap in this scenario.
Automatic Facial Recognition is a competent biometrics technology that is used in human machine interaction, security systems, and image processing techniques. Smart attendance system with a modern face recognition system is a real-time solution to handle students with their day-to-day activities and can be used to detect human faces automatically by capturing the current date and time.

## TECH STACK USED
